Marie Curie was a pioneering physicist and chemist who conducted groundbreaking research on radioactivity. Born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, Poland, she moved to Paris to study at the Sorbonne, where she earned degrees in physics and mathematics. Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and remains the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields: Physics and Chemistry.

Her most notable contributions include the discovery of the elements polonium and radium. Curie's work laid the foundation for the field of atomic physics and opened new avenues for the treatment of cancer through radiation therapy. She established research institutes in Paris and Warsaw, which continue to contribute to the sciences today. Marie Curie passed away on July 4, 1934, but her legacy as a scientist and advocate for women in science endures.
